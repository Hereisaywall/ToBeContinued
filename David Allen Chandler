i am peiring into depths of realization
the seperating facts of hesitation
which grab ahold to substance of i be
the what that is inside that not can see
the touching down upon a spot i reconnect
inside of me these words seek to correct
only there i am realized to come and start
seperating with the hear my mouth holds art
as it builds up to be shield the inner being
the outer trembles lightly please stop seeing
please stop trying to find me apart from you
i'm the body of the world you came into
i'm what caught you here inside of all is seen
now i know that you exist there in between
you accepted all that flesh and blood can offer
the treasures of there is in mighty coffer
for without me you were never now you find
i've become the maze you called eacaping blind
